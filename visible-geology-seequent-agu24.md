I was at AGU24 and was surprised to run into Seequent's new marketing campaign around Visible Geology, a tool that I created in 2010 and sold to Seequent in 2016. About 14 years later, they have decided to use Visible Geology as their main way of marketing at conferences. It makes sense — Visible Geology is a free and useful tool that people love, over 1M people had used it in the first decade that it existed, and I am glad to see that the Visible Geology brand and tool will live on. I was presenting two booths over on my next science communication tool, Curvenote — excited to see what another decade brings for those tools. 🚀
