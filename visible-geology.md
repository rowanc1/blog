I created Visible Geology in 2010, an online 3D geologic modeling tool.

Visible Geology allows you to create geologic block diagrams in three-dimensions in your browser. You can add geologic beds, folds, dikes, faults, and titling events and then explore your geology on different topographies. You can create cross-sections and boreholes in seconds, and explore data on an interactive stereonet!

I sold [Visible Geology to Seequent](./story.md) in 2016, and they have since relaunched the app as their main [marketing tool for all of Seequent](./visible-geology-seequent-agu24.md).

Below is the application that I built in 2010, [captured by the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20150904210912/http://app.visiblegeology.com/Visiblegeology.html). For the latest version, which is more like a video game, see https://visiblegeology.com.
