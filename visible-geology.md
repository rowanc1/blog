Visible Geology allows you to create geologic block diagrams in three-dimensions in your browser. You can add geologic beds, folds, dikes, faults, and titling events and then explore your geology on different topographies. You can create cross-sections and boreholes in seconds, and explore data on an interactive stereonet!
