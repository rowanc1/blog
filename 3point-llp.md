:::{note} Note
Below is our public application for the Lean-Launch-Pad program in 2015.
:::

## What is your product/service?

Online 3D model visualization and interrogation for geoscientists. We are targeting the oil and gas industry through seismic visualization, the mining industry through geophysical data interrogation, and individual scientists who need to communicate their modeling results.

## What unmet need does it fulfill, or problems does it solve?

Beyond static images, it is impossible to share 3D models with peers, clients, or the public who do not have specific software and knowhow (i.e. most of them!). Our browser-based delivery, and simple user interface, allows non-technical stakeholders to participate in and drive technical discussions. Our tools enable use in non-traditional settings such as training courses, lectures, technical documentation, hallways, and boardrooms.

## Who is your typical customer that has the above need?

Our customers are technical staff in industry or academic researchers who are motivated to communicate their work easily and accurately with a variety of disparate groups. There are a variety of industries which require accurate, fast, and ubiquitous 3D visualization. For example, oil and gas, mining exploration, environmental consulting, medical imaging, and numerical scientists in government and academia. We allow our customers to have meaningful data-driven conversations in real time, and react to discussions in a meaningful way.

## Who are your competitors - or how do people solve the problem currently?

People currently send each other annotated screenshots of their model results, this static medium does not promote two way communication and can lead to longer turnaround times on important decisions. There are a number of startups in oil and gas, architecture, and medical imaging who are pursuing a similar business model.

## Why is your product or service better than the competition or alternative ways to solve the problem?

We have five years of experience working in geoscience education visualization, and realize the importance of simple visualizations targeted to explain and interrogate individual concepts. Our cloud based approach allows these models to be shown on any device, and annotations and notes to be synced to a central location. This means saving time in organizational nightmares, and having discussions in a meeting that are actionable when you return to your desk.

## Provide a sketch, image or mock-up of your product or service

## What is the stage of development of your product or service?

In 2014, we partnered with a super-major oil and gas company to bring 3D visualizations into their new-hire training program. These tools allowed every new-hire the capability to interactively interrogate proprietary sub-surface models in a classroom setting. We are in the process of adding capabilities to have seismic visualization and sketch-based interpretation such that these tools can be used outside the training environment.

## What are the next steps in the development of your product or service?

Our modular approach in our technical development allows us to walk the line between visualization consulting and product development. We are then able to work closely with clients to experience their problems and develop products that can address these and be deployed at scale. We will use the Lean-Launch-Pad to target our questions and development goals.
