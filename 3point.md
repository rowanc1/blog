I co-founded 3point Science in 2013 with Adam Pidlisecky and Tara Moran where we built web-based visualization software for the geoscience industry. We experimented in three different industries, built things, hired people, launched websites, wrote grants, got rejected, pivoted, bootstrapped, launched, and pitched visions of the future. I was also a full-time [PhD student](phd.md). It was crazy.

[3point Science was acquired](https://www.seequent.com/aranz-geo-acquires-3point-science/) by Seequent (formerly Aranz Geo) in March 2016, and I remained on as the CTO; helping to start the Calgary office of the company. [Seequent](http://seequent.com) is a global geoscience software company and in 2017 they were making desktop software — my team was put in charge of transforming their desktop products (primarily [Leapfrog 3D](http://www.leapfrog3d.com/)) with online collaboration, web-based [3D visualization](scipy2016-steno3d.md), and version control, the products and technologies I worked on became [Seequent Central](https://www.seequent.com/products-solutions/seequent-central).
I ran the cloud platform team for four years as the [VP of Cloud Architecture](vp-cloud-architecture.md), reporting directly to the CEO; Seequent [sold in 2021 for $1.05B](https://www.seequent.com/bentley-systems-enters-into-1-05-billion-agreement-to-acquire-seequent-global-leader-in-3d-modeling-software-for-the-geosciences/).
Selling my first company, building & leading global teams, and creating beautifully designed, technically outstanding products was a [fantastic experience](seequent-learnings.md).
