In 2018 I was nominated for a early career achievement award at the University of Calgary for my work and leadership on [Visible Geology](visible-geology.md), [SimPEG](simpeg.md) and entrepreneurial work starting [3point Science](story.md). I received the Award in September 2018, some videos and pictures are below.
